# It's Log!
Hey kid! You want a :gift:? How 'bout a :bike:? a :video_game:? Well, okay. You pick a :gift:.  

:musical_note:  
What rolls down stairs alone or in pairs, and over your neighbor's :dog:?  
What's great for a snack, and fits on your back?  

It's log, it's log, it's big, it's heavy, it's wood.  
It's log, it's log, it's better than bad, it's good.  

Everyone wants a log.  
You're gonna love it, log.  
Come on and get your log.  
Everyone needs a log.
